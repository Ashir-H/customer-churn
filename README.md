# Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving a business (churning). The goal is to help stakeholders take proactive retention actions by using machine learning to classify churn based on customer attributes and behavior.
It also attempts to analyze the most correlated attributes to identify target areas.
